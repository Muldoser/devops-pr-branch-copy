# DevOps Pull Request Branch Copy

This chrome plugin is made for people working with Azure DevOps Pull Requests, who might want to check out the branch of the PR in question to test and review it.
Because the branch is an anchor tag in the page, it is easy to accidentally click on it and navigate outside of the page.
To easily copy the name to your clipboard, you will be able to click on a button next to the branch name. After that, you should be able to `git checkout ` and paste the branch.
